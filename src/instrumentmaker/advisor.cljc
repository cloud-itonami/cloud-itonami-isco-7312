(ns instrumentmaker.advisor
  "Instrument Maker Advisor — proposing a musical-instrument-making/
  tuning workshop scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a
  work record, schedule a crew operation, flag a safety concern,
  coordinate an instrument-materials supply order) from a crew
  roster, workshop registration and safety-reporting policy.
  Swappable mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes —
  `instrumentmaker.governor` independently gates every proposal and
  always escalates safety concerns and above-threshold supply orders.
  The advisor never proposes to directly finalize an
  instrument-construction/tuning-execution decision (e.g. deciding to
  proceed with the instrument-construction step or the tuning
  execution of a specific instrument) or to override a workshop
  safety officer's judgment — those stay permanently out of this
  actor's scope. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7222's advisor for the
  physical-safety-domain shape.
