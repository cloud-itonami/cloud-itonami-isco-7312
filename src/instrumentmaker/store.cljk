  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 7312 musical-instrument-making/tuning workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination actor (itonami actor pattern,
  ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section; README's 'Robotics
  premise' — a workshop scheduling/logistics coordination robot
  performs crew scheduling, task/materials-usage/progress-record
  logging and instrument-materials supply-order coordination for a
  musical-instrument-making/tuning crew under this advisor/governor
  pair, which never dispatches hardware itself, never builds or tunes
  an instrument itself, and never finalizes an
  instrument-construction/tuning-execution decision or overrides a
  workshop safety officer's judgment — those remain the workshop
  safety officer's exclusive judgment). Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7222's toolmaker.store for the
  physical-safety-domain shape.

  Domain:

    worker   — a registered instrument-making/tuning-workshop crew
               member (:worker-id, :name)
    workshop — a registered instrument-making/tuning workshop
               {:workshop-id :name :max-supply-cost number}.
               `:max-supply-cost` is an informational registered
               ceiling used only to decide whether a
               `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates to human
               sign-off (the governor never blocks a within-threshold
               order outright; it only decides commit vs. escalate).
    record   — a committed operating record (a logged
               task/materials-usage/progress entry, a scheduled crew
               operation, a flagged safety concern, or a coordinated
               supply order) — written ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger   — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
