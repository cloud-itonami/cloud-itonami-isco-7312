# Security Policy

This project handles musical instrument makers/tuners operating
workflows. Treat vulnerabilities as potentially high impact even when
the demo data is synthetic — this domain's failure modes include
physical worker-safety risk from woodworking/metalworking tools and
materials (tool-hazard injury, fume exposure from lacquers and
adhesives).

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real worker, workshop or operator data exposure
- authorization bypass
- Instrument Maker Governor bypass
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in reports or exports
- unsafe robot action dispatch
- any path that lets a proposal reach an
  instrument-construction/tuning-execution decision, or a
  workshop-safety-officer-override decision

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on worker/workshop data, policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real worker/workshop/operator data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
